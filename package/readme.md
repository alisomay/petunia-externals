# Petunia Externals

An eclectic collection of maxMSP externals from me which proved to be useful and interesting in my musical journey.

List of externals:

- [`rytm`](externals/rytm/README.md): A MaxMSP external to communicate with Analog Rytm MKII through sysex.

# Installation

If Cycling 74 accepts the package, you can install it through the package manager maxMSP. According to their response I'll remove this line.

One can obtain the package (pre built) from the [releases](https://github.com/alisomay/petunia-externals/releases) page which contains builds for major operating systems.

If you want to build the package yourself, you will need to install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then, please follow the build and install instructions from [median](https://github.com/Cycling74/median/blob/develop/median/README.md) repository.

All cargo make commands documented there would work.

## Contributing

I am aware that this is a very niche project, did by a single person and the code base is not very well documented.

On the other hand I still think that an experienced developer in the field may follow it easily.

I'm always open to contributions and I'll do my best to help you understand the code base and the project.

Rust [code of conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) applies to this project. Please be nice and respectful.

Use it as you wish but if you do something commercial and make a lot of money which is not very likely please consider giving some of that to me also :smile:.
